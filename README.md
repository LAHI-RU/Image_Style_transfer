# Image Style Transfer Project

This project implements neural style transfer using PyTorch. The model combines the content of one image with the style of another to generate a stylized output.

## Features
- Uses a pre-trained VGG-19 model for feature extraction.
- Customizable content and style images.
- Outputs high-quality stylized images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Pillow

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/image-style-transfer.git
   cd image-style-transfer

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Add your `content.jpg` and `style.jpg` images to the root directory.
2. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. The stylized image will be saved in the `output/` directory.

## Example
