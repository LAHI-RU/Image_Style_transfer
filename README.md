# Image Style Transfer Project

This project implements neural style transfer using PyTorch. The model combines the content of one image with the style of another to generate a stylized output.

## Features
- Uses a pre-trained VGG-19 model for feature extraction.
- Customizable content and style images.
- Outputs high-quality stylized images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Pillow

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/image-style-transfer.git
   cd image-style-transfer
